# *Weather-Application* :

This is a simple weather application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

The main advantage of this application is that users can search for the weather of any place and compare the temperature with five other famous cities (already given, if we want we can easily change the cities as per our convenience) which will help them in different fields.

Basically users will get the facility of visualising the weather difference in between the target city and already provided famous cities in real-time in a simple tabular manner, so that it can be easy to understand.

## Features:

- Search for weather by city name
- View current temperature, minimum and maximum temperature, cloud percentage, humidity, wind degree, wind speed, sunrise, and sunset time
- Compare weather data with five other cities in real-time
